    "Nowadays it is not uncommon to find yourself working with multi-gigabyte datasets, especially if youâ€™re planning to pretrain a transformer like BERT or GPT-2 from scratch. In these cases, even loading the data can be a challenge. For example, the WebText corpus used to pretrain GPT-2 consists of over 8 million documents and 40 GB of text â€” loading this into your laptopâ€™s RAM is likely to give it a heart attack!\n",
