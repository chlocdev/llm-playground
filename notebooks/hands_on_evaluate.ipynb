    "The **BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy)** BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) is an algorithm for evaluating the quality of text which has been machine-translated from one natural language to another ( evaluating a generated sentence to a reference sentence ). Quality is considered to be the correspondence between a machine’s output and that of a human: “the closer a machine translation is to a professional human translation, the better it is” – this is the central idea behind BLEU. BLEU was one of the first metrics to claim a high correlation with human judgements of quality, and remains one of the most popular automated and inexpensive metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scores are calculated for individual translated segments—generally sentences—by comparing them with a set of good quality reference translations. Those scores are then averaged over the whole corpus to reach an estimate of the translation’s overall quality. Neither intelligibility nor grammatical correctness are not taken into account. Here's the formula to calculate the BLEU score:\n",
    "\n",
    "### BLEU score formula:\n",

    "\\text{BLEU} = \\text{BP} \\times \\exp\\left( \\sum_{n=1}^{N} w_n \\cdot \\log p_n \\right)\n",

    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **BP** is the **brevity penalty** to account for shorter candidate translations:\n",

    "  e^{(1 - \\frac{r}{c})} & \\text{if } c \\leq r\n",
    "  \\end{cases}\n",
    "  \\$\n",
    "  - \\$ c \\$ is the length of the candidate translation.\n",
    "  - \\$ r \\$ is the length of the reference translation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\\$ p_n \\$** is the precision for n-grams of size \\( n \\):\n",

    "  \\$\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\\$ w_n \\$** is the weight for each n-gram level, typically uniform:\n",
    "  \\$\n",
    "  w_n = \\frac{1}{N}\n",
    "  \\$\n",
    "  For example, if using 4-grams, the weights are \\$ w_1 = w_2 = w_3 = w_4 = 0.25 \\$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **N** is the maximum length of the n-grams (often 4, so you consider unigrams, bigrams, trigrams, and 4-grams).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps for calculation:\n",
    "1. **Calculate precision** for unigrams, bigrams, trigrams, etc.\n",
    "2. **Apply the brevity penalty** (BP) to penalize overly short candidate translations.\n",
    "3. Combine the precision values for different n-grams using the geometric mean (exponential of their sum).\n",
    "4. Multiply the result by the brevity penalty.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations and Bias\n",
    "\n",
    "This metric has multiple known limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- BLEU compares overlap in tokens from the predictions and references, instead of comparing meaning. This can lead to discrepancies between BLEU scores and human ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Shorter predicted translations achieve higher scores than longer ones, simply due to how the score is calculated. A brevity penalty is introduced to attempt to counteract this.\n",
    "\n",
    "- BLEU scores are not comparable across different datasets, nor are they comparable across different languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "- BLEU scores can vary greatly depending on which parameters are used to generate the scores, especially when different tokenization and normalization techniques are used. It is therefore not possible to compare BLEU scores generated using different parameters, or when these parameters are unknown. For more discussion around this topic, see the following issue.\n"

Unigrams can be matched based on their surface forms, stemmed forms, and meanings; furthermore, METEOR can be easily extended to include more advanced matching strategies. Once all generalized unigram matches between the two strings have been found, METEOR computes a score for this matching using a combination of unigram-precision, unigram-recall, and a measure of fragmentation that is designed to directly capture how well-ordered the matched words in the machine translation are in relation to the reference.\n",
